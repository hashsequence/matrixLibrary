# Matrix Library Javascript vs. C++

Comparison of LU Inversion of Matrix class implementation in JavaScript and C++ 

[javascript](javascript/)

[cpp](cpp/)

## Summary

This project is to compare the performance of a Matrix Class implementation in C++ and Javascript that can work with standard numeric data types such as int and doubles as well as custom data classes. We will be implementing LU Inversion of a matrix and comparing the performance of the Matrix library with standard data types as well as with custom Classes.

## Requirements

* Both C++ and Javascript Implementations will implement a Matrix class and a LUInversion() method to invert an invertible matrix A by LU decomposing it into L U, invert them, and take the product <sup>-1</sup> * L<sup>-1</sup> to get A<sup>-1</sup>. 

* Test and benchmark the C++ and Javascript Matrix Libraries

* Implement Fractions Class as the sample custom class and allow the instantiation of a Matrix of fractions

### Bonus

* Implement other Matrix operations such as Determinants

### Limitations And Scope

Since the purpose of this project is to compare the same algorithmic calculation (LU Inversion ), the project will only focus on performing the operation on a already invertible matrix and comparing the performance.
